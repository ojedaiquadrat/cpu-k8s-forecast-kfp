# 1.Stage

✅ What You’re Doing Well

Loading & Preprocessing Data from MinIO

✅ You correctly load the preprocessed CSV from MinIO.

✅ The timestamp column is parsed and set as index — good for time series.

✅ You isolate the target feature: ac3-node-1-vm_cpu_pct.

Normalization

✅ MinMaxScaler is used to normalize values between 0 and 1.

✅ Timestamp is excluded from scaling — correct.

✅ Scaler is saved to MinIO — nice for reproducibility and inverse transforms later.

Sliding Window Sequence Creation

✅ Your create_sequences() function is correct.

✅ You reshape the data to [samples, time_steps, 1], which is the correct shape for LSTM models.

Train/Test Split

✅ You split data without shuffling (correct for time series).

✅ You wrap the NumPy arrays into PyTorch TensorDataset and then use DataLoader — perfectly done.
